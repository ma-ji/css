## Mission statements of nonprofit organizations in English, French, and Korean

This dataset contains texts of nonprofits' mission statements. The [data of US nonprofits](https://github.com/ma-ji/npo_classifier/tree/master/dataset/UCF) are the most comprehensive and developed and are extracted from [the IRS 990 Forms](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/form-990-resources-and-tools#:~:text=Form%20990%20is%20the%20IRS,the%20public%20about%20their%20programs.). 

A few other sources that can complement this dataset: 

- [Charity Navigator Data API](https://charity.3scale.net/docs/data-api/reference), contains nonprofit performance and financial information.
- [Nonprofit Explorer by ProPublica](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/), user-friendly data platform based on the machine-readable data of IRS 990 forms.
- [Candid API](https://candid.org/use-our-data/apis).
