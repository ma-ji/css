College level statistics. For example, be confident to test the difference between means, run hypothesis testing with probability theories, understand OLS and fixed effect models.

## Intermediate to advanced programming skills

Programming may be intimidating, but remember you are coding for social good and "Sometimes it's the people no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine." -- The Imitation Game (2014)

The class is Python based, but you can use R or any other programming language as long as you can complete the assignments and final challenge. If you haven't used Python for a while or not familiar with it, please complete an online tutorial before taking this class. Example Python packages used in this course: Pandas, Requests, regular expression, NetworkX, NLTK, TensorFlow, Keras, etc. We will introduce these packages in class, but you should be familiar with Python programming in general before class.
