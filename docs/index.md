This course introduces computational social science methods and contexualize these methods within social science research design. The first part of this course (w1--w3) gives you an overview of this course, research design, and programming fundamentals. You will also learn how to use [high-performance cloud computing resources](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/systems/chameleon). The second part (w4--w12) is analysis-oriented and primarily covers text analysis (w4--w8; with an emphasis on multilingual language analysis) and network analysis (w9--w12). Bilingual or multilingual language ability is a plus. Programming is an essential part of this course but not the purpose. We will be coding for social good.

The course has demanding [prerequisites](/prerequisites); therefore, you probably need to work on the [prerequisites](/prerequisites) in 2022 summer and fall if you are highly motivated. All registrations need to be approved by the instructor in late 2022 fall. You can [join the learning group here](https://uta-css.slack.com).

# Resources

## _Recommended_ (not required) textbooks

The two books give you a good theoretical understanding and are very useful in research design.

- [GRS] Grimmer, Justin, Margaret E. Roberts, and Brandon M. Stewart. 2022. Text as Data: A New Framework for Machine Learning and the Social Sciences. Princeton, New Jersey Oxford: Princeton University Press.
- [SJ] Scott, John. 2017. Social Network Analysis. Fourth edition. Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications Ltd. (different versions are fine)

The two books/sources introduce more technical and hands-on details.

- [JM] Jurafsky, Daniel, and James H. Martin. 2022. Speech and Language Processing. 3rd draft. https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/. (the authors generously made their book publicly available, check their website and use the latest version)
- [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) (the package's documentation and the references cited are the best place to start in terms of technical details)
