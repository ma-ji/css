This course is academic and research oriented, it introduces and contextualizes computational methods from a social science research design perspective. The first part of this course (w1--w3) gives you an overview of this course, how to use [high-performance cloud computing resources](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/systems/chameleon), and how to analyze computational methods from a research design perspective. The second part (w4--w13) will analyze different computational methods according to their roles in social science research. Students will present their [final research project](/final) in the last week. Bilingual or multilingual language ability is a plus. Programming is an essential part of this course but not the purpose and will not be taught. We will be coding for social good.

The course has demanding [prerequisites](/prerequisites); therefore, you probably need to work on the [prerequisites](/prerequisites) over the winter break if you are highly motivated. All registrations need to be approved by the instructor in late 2023. Please provide either (1) your code scripts, or (2) a committed learning plan during the winter break, for me to evaluate your preparedness.
