This course introduces methodologies for linked open data and computational social science. The first part of this course is theory-oriented and covers concepts in linking data and open data policies. You will also learn how to use [high-performance cloud computing resources](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/systems/chameleon). The second part is analysis-oriented and covers network analysis, text analysis, and text classification using neural networks. Meanwhile, we will introduce [Awesome Public Datasets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets) according to the class's interests. Each of you will present a dataset by your selection. The final part is challenge-oriented. You will form groups to complete a challenge as your final project. 

Although programming is an essential part of this course, the course schedule and reading materials are framed within a social science context. We will be coding for social good.

### Prerequisites

#### Statistics

College level statistics. For example, you are confident to use probability for hypothesis testing, you can run and understand OLS and multivariate regression.

#### Intermediate to advanced programming skills

The class is Python based, but you can use R or any other programming language as long as you can complete the assignments and final challenge. If you haven't used Python for a while or not familiar with it, please complete an online tutorial before taking this class. Example Python packages used in this course: Pandas, Requests, regular expression, NetworkX, NLTK, TensorFlow, Keras, etc. We will introduce these packages in class, but you should be familiar with Python programming in general before class.
