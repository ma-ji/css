This course introduces computational social science methods and contexualize these computational methods within social science research design. The first part of this course (w1--w3) gives you an overview and introduces programming fundamentals. You will also learn how to use [high-performance cloud computing resources](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/systems/chameleon). The second part (w4--w12) is analysis-oriented and primarily covers text analysis (w4--w8; with an emphasis on multilingual language analysis) and network analysis (w9--w12). Bilingual or multilingual language ability is a plus. Programming is an essential part of this course but not the purpose. We will be coding for social good.
