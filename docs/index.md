This course introduces computational social science methods and contexualize these computational methods within social science research design. The first part of this course (w1--w3) gives you an overview and introduces programming fundamentals. You will also learn how to use [high-performance cloud computing resources](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/systems/chameleon). The second part (w4--w12) is analysis-oriented and primarily covers text analysis (w4--w8) and network analysis (w9--w12). Programming is an essential part of this course, but it is not the purpose. We will be coding for the social good.

# Prerequisites

## Good with numbers

The way to happiness is simple, you just "Be good with numbers, and be good with people." -- The Pursuit of Happyness (2006)

College level statistics. For example, be confident to test the difference between means, run hypothesis testing with probability theories, understand OLS and fixed effect models.

## Intermediate to advanced programming skills

Programming may be intimidating, but remember you are coding for the social good and "Sometimes it's the people no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine." -- The Imitation Game (2014)

Start coding today.

The class is Python based, but you can use R or any other programming language as long as you can complete the assignments and final challenge. If you haven't used Python for a while or not familiar with it, please complete an online tutorial before taking this class. Example Python packages used in this course: Pandas, Requests, regular expression, NetworkX, NLTK, TensorFlow, Keras, etc. We will introduce these packages in class, but you should be familiar with Python programming in general before class.
