This course introduces computational social science methods and contextualize these methods within social science research design. 

1. The first part of this course (w1--w3) gives you an overview of this course, programming fundamentals, and how to use [high-performance cloud computing resources](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/systems/chameleon). 

2. The second part (w4--w12) is analysis-oriented and primarily covers text analysis (w4--w8; with an emphasis on multilingual language analysis) and network analysis (w9--w12). 

3. The last few weeks focus on research design with computational methods and final project. 

Bilingual or multilingual language ability is a plus. Programming is an essential part of this course but not the purpose. We will be coding for social good.

The course has demanding [prerequisites](/prerequisites); therefore, you probably need to work on the [prerequisites](/prerequisites) in 2022 summer and fall if you are highly motivated. All registrations need to be approved by the instructor in late 2022 fall. You can [join the learning group](https://uta-css.slack.com) where more learning resources will be shared.
