### Week 5: Harshal Zalke

#### Dataset Introduction: [IMF Data](https://www.imf.org/en/Data)
I will be using the [IMF database](https://www.imf.org/en/Data) to gather data on loans provided to different developing countries and the conditions attached with each loan.

#### Related Academic Study
Dreher, Axel, Jan-Egbert Sturm, and James Raymond Vreeland. "Global horse trading: IMF loans for votes in the United Nations Security Council." European Economic Review 53, no. 7 (2009): 742-757.

This paper studies the relationship between IMF loans approved to developig countries and theier membership status in the United Nations Security Council. The authors propose that temporary members of the United Nations Security Council are more likely to get their loan requests approved. For this, they use a panel data for 197 countries over the period from 1951 to 2004. They check the number of loans approved for each country between these years. They also check the number of conditions attached with each loan. The study finds that not only do the temporary members of UNSC are more likely to get their loan request approved but the conditions attached with loans are also fewer. The authors conclude that IMF loans is a mechanism by which shareholders of the fund win favor with voting members of the United Nations.
