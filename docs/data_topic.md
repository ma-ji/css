### Week 3: [Andrew Messamore's Data Topic](https://data.cityofchicago.org/).

#### Dataset Introduction

This is the city of Chicago's open data API. I hope to use it to look at how civic organizations impact the quality of housing and other important social issues.

* This article presents a case study of the open data project in the Chicago area. The main purpose of the research is to explore empowering potential of an open data phenomenon at the local level as a platform useful for promotion of civic engagement projects and provide a framework for future research and hypothesis testing. Today the main challenge in realization of any e-government projects is a traditional top–down administrative mechanism of their realization itself practically without any input from members of the civil society. In this respect, the author of the article argues that the open data concept realized at the local level may provide a real platform for promotion of proactive civic engagement. By harnessing collective wisdom of the local communities, their knowledge and visions of the local challenges, governments could react and meet citizens' needs in a more productive and cost-efficient manner. Open data-driven projects that focused on visualization of environmental issues, mapping of utility management, evaluating of political lobbying, social benefits, closing digital divide, etc. are only some examples of such perspectives. These projects are perhaps harbingers of a new political reality where interactions among citizens at the local level will play a more important role than communication between civil society and government due to the empowering potential of the open data concept.

### Week 9 - Nov 4: [T. Oladimeji's Data Topic](https://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml)

### Dataset background
This is the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's data portal. My aim is to be able to study how CEO beliefs predict strategic actions/firm performance.

### Related study
* Koch‐Bayram, Irmela F., and Georg Wernicke. "Drilled to obey? Ex‐military CEOs and financial misconduct." Strategic Management Journal 39.11 (2018): 2943-2964.
* Abstract: We examine the influence of CEOs' military background on financial misconduct using two distinctive datasets. First, we make use of accounting and auditing enforcement releases (AAER) issued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which contain intentional and substantial cases of financial fraud. Second, we use a dataset of “lucky grants,” which provide a measure of the likelihood of grant dates of CEOs' stock options having been manipulated. Results for both datasets indicate that CEOs who served in the military are less inclined to be involved in fraudulent financial reporting and to backdate stock options. In addition, we find that these relationships are moderated by board oversight (CEO duality and independent directors in the board).
